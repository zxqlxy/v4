Designed data structures (alleles, geneTree, imageFunction, etc.) that streamlines representing, composing, and randomizing image functions through functional programming.
Implemented a genetic algorithm that iteratively improves existing gene trees through crossbreeding and mutation to produce artificial images.
Integrated the backend computation with a web page to enhance user experience
