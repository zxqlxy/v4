Analyzed the data of tens of millions of collisions of J/psi mesons and strange charm mesons collected from [LHC](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider). Used boost decision tree, rectangular cut and MLP to train the data to get a better selection of the signal through [TMVA](http://tmva.sourceforge.net/). Manipulated data stored in trees and visualized them via [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/). Optimized the C++ software in the Linux environment and increased the signal significance by 200%.
